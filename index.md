### BMSdori (2019)
A fork of the iBMSC BMS editor, modified to render note types according to mobile rhythm game *BanG Dream! Girls Band Party!*  
With a little asset manipulation through tools like UABE and Unity AssetStudio, custom charts can be played in-game.  
**The following is a placeholder video showing only the result of a custom chart. Footage of a demonstration of BMSdori's unique features should be added soon.**

### osu!lazer (2019)
*osu!* is a rhythm game in which players click circles, or notes, to the beat as the ring around them closes in. *osu!lazer* is a new, open-source version of osu! by the same developer.  
This video showcases an attempt at a custom gameplay modification, in which circles grow outwards instead of having an approach circle close inwards. Unfortunately, my development of this gameplay modification was discontinued as a different contributor had been able to complete and add it to the game first.

### Call of Duty weapon ports (2015 - 2016)
One of my first experiences with game modding and a look at how things are done behind the scenes. Call of Duty titles released between 2007 and 2014 generally have good backwards and forward compatability between first-person weapon animations, meaning it is relatively easy to create mods that include weapon assets from different Call of Duty titles if the target game supports modding.  
My target game in this case was *Call of Duty 2*, released in 2005, so a little experimentation and tweaking was necessary to make weapon animations from later games work on a slightly different first-person rig.

## Academic Projects

### Locally Invariant Feature Matching (2019)
Given a pre-computed set of locally invariant keypoints and descriptors for an image, keypoints are matched between two images.  
Noise and outliers are reduced by first eliminating matches that have significantly different angles from the mean, then performing random sample consensus.

### Texture Synthesis (2019)
An implementation of the Efros-Leung texture synthesis method. Select a region from which to sample the texture, and a region over which the texture will be synthesized, and a statistically similar texture will be generated.

### Template Matching (2019)
Basic template matching techniques implemented by correlation with a scaled pyramid.
